	## Main reasons
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
	### Financial Deregulation

	Financial deregulation has encouraged companies to have different financing options to reduce their reliance on bank funding.

	![Distribution of Bank Credit to Industries](img/tab_distribution_of_bank_credit_to_industries.png)<!-- .element: width="70%" -->

	Note:
	Financial deregulation has encouraged companies to have different financing options to reduce their reliance on bank funding. In the 1980s, Japanese banks shifted the main target of credit supply from manufacturing to real estate, finance and other non-tradable goods sectors that were not subject to global competition.

	From this table of Distribution of Bank Credit to Industries, we can see this phenomenon clearly. Before the bubble economy era, the bank credit to manufacturing is the highest, it means that manufacturing can have a higher investment in their products. And since the bubble economy began, the credit provide to manufacturing decrease constantly and arrive 14.9% in 1995. By contrast, the real estate, finance from the original allocation of credit at least to the top, especially real estate.

	### Asset Price Deflation

	#### Inadequate prudential regulations

	- In May 1981, Japan revised its banking law and securities law, which stipulated that banks could operate securities business.<!-- .element: style="font-size:80%" -->
	- From 1983 to 1989, banks gradually participated in the business of national debt market, commercial paper market and financial futures market.<!-- .element: style="font-size:80%" -->
	- After 1984, Japan implemented the "special money trust" system, that is, major shareholders can entrust full power of funds to securities companies for transactions.<!-- .element: style="font-size:80%" -->

	Banks' investments in real estate rose sharply.

	Note:
	In the first half of the 1980’s, control on capital movements were dismantled, interest rates on deposits deregulated and new financial institutions were in place. 

	<u>??? As banks lost large firms to the international capital markets and domestic securities markets, they found alternative lending prospects in small and medium sized firms. These firms were able to borrow for risky or low-return projects simply on the basis of real estate collateral.</u>
	</script></section>

	### Asset Price Deflation

	#### Loose monetary policy

	Monetary policy implemented in the second half of the 1980s also contributed to asset price inflation.<!-- .element: style="font-size:70%" -->

	![Japanese official discount rate](img/tab_discount_rate.png)<!-- .element: width="50%" -->

	Note:
	此外，20世纪80年代后半期实施的货币政策也加剧了资产价格通胀。我们可以在这一张从1980年到1990年的日本官方贴现率表中看出，从1980年3月19日开始，官方贴现率不断下降。在1985年底至1987年初期间分几次下调了一半，至2.5%，并在两年内保持不变

	Moreover, monetary policy implemented in the second half of the 1980s also contributed to asset price inflation. As we can see from this table of Japan's official discount rate from 1980 to 1990, the official discount rate continued to decline from March 19, 1980 and the the basic point keeps negative constantly. The official discount rate was cut in half in several installments between late 1985 and early 1987. it arrives to 2.5 percent, and remained unchanged for two years.

	(****Discount rate refers to the interest rate used to change future payments into present value, or refers to the interest rate used by the bank to deduct the interest in advance when the holder requests the bank to cash the bill which is not due.The lower the discount rate, the higher the value of the same dollar of future income or expenditure is translated into today's money. When the value of cash goes up)

	Driven by the continuous reduction of interest rates, Japan's money supply increased rapidly, from 295 trillion yen in 1985 to 483 trillion yen in 1990, with an average annual growth rate of 10%. However, Japan's GDP growth averaged only 5 percent over the same period, the excess money supply was bound to lead to money flowing into the capital and real estate markets, **contributing to the bubble**.

	在利率不断降低的作用下，日本货币供应量快速增加，从1985 年的 295 兆日元增加至 1990 年的 483 兆日元，年均增幅达10%。考虑到同期日本 GDP 的平均增速仅为 5%，过剩的货币供应必然导致资金流向资本市场和房地产市场，从而促使泡沫形成。

	(到1989年，甚至财政部也认识到房地产和股票价格的泡沫是不可持续的。他们相信这些价格水平最终会下降。与他们的想法相反，银行总资产从1989年的508万亿日元急剧下降到1990年的491万亿日元。货币政策从1989年5月开始急剧收紧，幅度 75 个基点， 随后同年的 10 月 11 日和 12 月 25 日、1990 年的 3 月 22日和 8 月 30 日又连续四次加息， 在短短的 15 个月内将官方贴现率上调至 6%，涨幅达 1.4 倍。股票价格在1990年初开始下跌，日经指数从1989年底的峰值下跌了60%以上。财政部出台了限制银行对房地产行业贷款总额的指导方针。股票价格的暴跌从1990年初开始，到1992年底结束。)

	### Investment

	The combination of the asset price boom and easy bank lending led to excessive investment spending in the second half of the 1980s.

	![Public Investment](img/public_investment.png)<!-- .element: width="45%" -->
	![Private Investment](img/private_investment.png)<!-- .element: width="45%" -->

	Note:
	从下图中，我们可以看见从1986年开始，不管public investment还是private investment都开始迅速增长。由于开展了许多低回报和高风险项目，资本产出比与其上升趋势相比显著增加。因此，在资产价格繁荣和银行宽松贷款政策的共同作用下，1980年代后半期的投资支出过度。

	Because the economy was booming at that time, the company felt confident to how optimistic firms are about their future sales and economic activity, so they spent a lot of money on investment. 

	From the figure below, we can see that since 1986, no matter public investment or private investment are beginning to grow rapidly. The capital-output ratio has increased significantly against its upward trend as a result of a number of low-return and high-risk projects. Thus, the combination of the asset price boom and easy bank lending led to excessive investment spending in the second half of the 1980s.This is fuelling inflation

	### The underlying reason: exchange-rate policy

	After the signing of the Plaza Accord, the governments of the five countries, including the United States and Japan, intervened in the foreign exchange market for a period of two months.<!-- .element: style="font-size:80%" -->

	![GDP](img/tab_gdp.png)<!-- .element: width="80%" -->

	Note:
	After World War II, Japan experienced rapid industrial growth with the support of the United States. We can see from this table, America's nominal share of GDP is very high.

	The Korean and Vietnam wars propelled Japan's economic boom in the late 1960s, it overtaking West Germany to become the world's third-largest economy. Japanese companies have slowly become a strong enemy of the United States.

	We can see the trade difference of imports and exports has been widening since 1970. 

	The United States blames all this on an excessive exchange rate and want to let the yen rose and the dollar fell.

	### General

	Despite the fact that the "Bubble Economy" largely ended in 1990, it wasn't until January 29, 1993, that a Japanese prime minister admitted that it had collapsed.

	Note:
	Despite the fact that the "Bubble Economy" largely ended in 1990, it wasn't until January 29, 1993, that a Japanese prime minister admitted that it had collapsed. The price level declined by 1.1 percent in the first three months of 1993, representing a deflation rate of about 4.5 percent per year. Wholesale prices were declining at a 4.2 percent annual rate by August 1993. Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2% annually in the second quarter of 1993. The Japanese economy was in a bad way. Instead of resolving structural faults, the bureaucracy's attempt to deal with the situation usually involved trying to utilize some scheme, a fast fix. The government attempted to enhance stock market prices by directing public financial institutions to purchase stocks. The banking system faced significant losses as a result of loans used to purchase real estate, but the bank tried to hide these losses. Employees were compensated with unsold products from the company. Japanese enterprises are discouraged from reducing their workforces by government regulation, although this puts them at danger of financial failure.

	### Household

	- Human mobility
	- Life
	- Unemployment

	Note:
	**Human mobility**

	Such economic shifts have had a significant impact on Japan's diverse types of human mobility. In terms of the business cycle, it is widely known that Japan's standing in the globe rose during the economic boom from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and the country became a popular destination for international migrants. In the mid-1990s, however, the reduction in land prices induced by the recession began to promote major in-migration to the central section of the Tokyo metropolitan region.

	In terms of international migration to Japan, during the bubble economy, a labor shortage resulted in a tremendous influx of foreigners. Even throughout the recession of the 1990s, this immigration continued, resulting in an increase in the foreign population. However, the current economic crisis has had such a negative impact that it has resulted in a decrease of foreign residents since 2009. The manufacturing bastion of the Nagoya metropolitan area and its environs, where manufacturing is a vital industry, felt the brunt of this influence. The Japanese government implemented a migration policy to assist migrant workers in the wake of the economic crisis. – more government spending

	**Life**

	“There were little noticeable effects of the bubble. The Japanese economy over all was increasing rapidly vis-a-vis the rest of the world, but - because of structural factors such as trade barriers and high savings - there was only a gradual effect on the people and the economy on a domestic level.” – Drew McC, Quora

	“About 1990–1 the more aware people noticed that the economy was slowing down, and Japanese investment abroad slowed down. The real bite came after I left.”

	“At any rate I was glad that I got out before the crash, because a number of friends who stayed had a hard time.” – David Parry, Quora

	**Unemployment**

	The impact is that Japan’s unemployment rate has risen, and about 1 to 2 million people are unemployed, which has led to a deterioration in living conditions. The people are blinded in responding to measures that are intervened by government policies.

	In 1985, New York introduced the "Plaza Accord." In this agreement, Japan was forced to agree to the agreement and allow the yen to appreciate substantially. This led to a domestic asset bubble. In just one year, a large amount of domestic funds poured into the real estate and stock markets.

	The Bank of Japan has continuously cut interest rates since 1986, hoping to prevent the domestic economy from collapsing. However, today, the yen interest rate has been closed to zero, and the deflation has remained the same. As a result, a large amount of bank bad debt has accumulated, resulting in an unprecedented depression of the Japanese economy.

	### Corporate

	- Manufacturers were having difficulty maintaining their competitive advantage.
	- Many Japanese firms were having significant difficulties reducing their debt ratios.

	Note:
	At the same time, because the economy was propelled by a high rate of reinvestment, the stock market was particularly heavily struck by the catastrophe. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 index fell from 38,915 at the end of December 1989 to 14,309 at the end of August 1992. It has plummeted to a post-bubble low of 7,862 by March 11, 2003. Manufacturers were having difficulty maintaining their competitive advantage as investments were being channeled out of the country, since most manufacturing firms had lost some degree of their technological edge. As a result, Japanese goods were less competitive in foreign markets.

	Since asset prices have fallen, growing liabilities on a long-term basis has given investors the impression of a weak balance sheet. Many Japanese firms were having significant difficulties reducing their debt ratios, leading to a reluctance on the part of the private sector to boost investments.

	The government continued to bail out failing banks and businesses that were losing money, making it hard for more efficient businesses to compete. Large Japanese banks provided a flood of loans to otherwise insolvent borrowers through phony debt restructurings. The term "zombie firm" was invented to represent Japanese businesses that couldn't meet their debt payment payments with existing profits for a lengthy length of time. Zombie businesses undercut competitive enterprises' earnings, stifle job growth, impair productivity, and discourage investment.

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
	### Financial and banking

	Banks continued to make loans with a low likelihood of repayment.

	Note:
	Banks continued to make loans with a low likelihood of repayment. Loan officers and investment employees had a difficult time identifying something to invest in that would yield a profit. They would occasionally put their investment cash in a competitor bank as conventional deposits, resulting in objections from the bank's loan officers and investment staff. The government began to subsidize failing banks and enterprises, resulting in a large number of "zombie enterprises," making it even more difficult to correct the credit problem. A carry trade eventually emerged, in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for profits elsewhere, and then the Japanese were paid back, leaving the trader with a tidy profit.

	<h2>What we can learn</h2>
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
	### from the bubble economy

	Note:
	The cause of the bubble economy

	1. The Bank of Japan

	The Bank of Japan bears the greatest responsibility for fuelling the bubble economy. At the very least, when the bubble began to form in the mid-1980s, the Bank of Japan should have pursued a prudent monetary policy, wary of the bubble's expansion. Instead of deflating the bubble, the central bank exacerbated it by pumping even more money into the Japanese economy, and it was the Bank of Japan that abetted the biggest speculation of its era.

	2. The rise of American high-tech companies

	For example, in Silicon Valley, such changes in the industrial chain have resulted in Japan no longer having an advantage in high-tech industries

	3. The rise of manufacturing in China and South Korea

	The labor costs of manufacturing in both countries, when overseas products enter the Japanese market, quickly overwhelm Japanese products due to the price advantage. Then through 2010, Sanyo's sales barely grew, while Samsung's increased fivefold and Haier's increased 90-fold.

	4. The capital is seriously out of real and into fictitious

	With the economic development, labor costs are getting higher and higher, and the cost of Japanese manufacturing enterprises is rising rapidly, and a large number of capital loans are needed to make up the cash hole. But with a lot of social capital and bank capital tied up in real estate and other investments, the supply of loans is far from sufficient to meet the needs of manufacturing enterprises.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
	Falling house prices are not the cause of unemployment and economic crisis.

	Note:
	Falling house prices are not the cause of unemployment and economic crisis

	The real logic is that as speculative markets suck capital away, real companies are limited in their production and research and development, weakened by the impact of international commodities, and thus laid off workers and went bankrupt. The broken capital chain of enterprises and people leads to the bank's bad debt, and the bank auctions the mortgage assets, which leads to the asset selling expectation. The bad debt impacts the capital market and finally leads to the decline of the housing price.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
	Even sustained fiscal deficits, zero interest rates and quantitative easing will not lead to soaring inflation in some cases.

	Note:
	Japan’s experience strongly suggests that even sustained fiscal deficits, zero interest rates and quantitative easing will not lead to soaring inflation in post-bubble economies suffering from excess capacity and a balance-sheet overhang. It also suggests that unwinding from such excess is a long-term process. Yet Japan’s experience also has a lesson for quite a different economy. It indicates that when fast growth begins to slow in a catch-up economy with very high corporate savings and comparably high fixed investment, demand may be extremely difficult to manage. This is particularly true if the deliberate promotion of credit growth and asset price bubbles has been part of the mechanism used to sustain demand. 
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
	Practical work and realistic innovation are the future.

	Note:
	Practical work, realistic innovation is the future

	Japan's economy has been recovering in recent years, and its services, tourism, semiconductors and car manufacturing are still the world's largest. The Nikkei index is also on a healthy path of slow rise. After experiencing the bubble shock, the Japanese people finally understand that pragmatism and innovation are the future of the nation. The bubble is just a dream.
